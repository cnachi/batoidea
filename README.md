Batoidea: Probabilistic Inference of Timing Properties in Multi-wavelength Light Curves
=======================================================================================

The time series of many astrophysical objects, in particular black holes and neutron stars, 
show complicated multiwavelength behaviour. This repository contains code to perform 
probabilistic inference on time series at multiple wavelengths along with other parameters 
of interest (such as the flux distribution and coherence properties)
